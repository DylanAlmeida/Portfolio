<h3 class="h3">Creating Bio Webpage</h3>
</font>
<div class="fortlyfe">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a freshman in IT at Greater New Bedford Regional Vocational Technical High School, one of the first projects I was assigned by my teacher Mr. Quintin was to make a biography webpage. 
I started by designing the webpage on a white piece of paper. After that I began to code the page and other pages to link to it. 
Lastly I created a navigation system to link all the pages together. 
Overall, I learned a lot about coding with this lesson, but, I struggled when learning the navigation system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I began designing the page, I started brainstorming some ideas of fonts and color schemes to use. I used a blue background with black font color because those two colors contrast well with each other. Since, I made the background blue I had to then change the color of links in my page because if not, the links would not show on the blue background. I gathered a few photos that I felt would work well on my bio webpage, I picked a headshot that I had taken of me and a group photo of my shop class. After, I wrote a paragraph talking about myself and some interesting facts. Once I had all the designs done, it was time to code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finalizing my design I got to work beginning to code the page. I opened up my skeleton template for coding with html; I changed the title, entered the date and got to work. I first made the heading of my webpage; I titled my page, "This Is Me". I did this using the &lt;h1&gt; tag. The &lt;h1&gt; tag makes a heading, there is &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;, &lt;h6&gt; is the smallest font size and &lt;h1&gt; is the largest font size. I then, added a line under the heading to separate the heading from the rest of the page. You can format the line using the &lt;hr&gt; tag. After the line, I added in my bio and my headshot picture. I formatted the picture using the &lt;img&gt; tag, the picture was to be the size of 300px x 400px. The code turned out to look like this:<strong> &lt;img src="headshot.jpg" width="300" height="400"&gt;.</strong> Then I aligned the photo and wrapped the text around it. Once all my code was written and I tested that it worked, I indented the lines of code which made it look neat and professional.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I had to make a navigation system to move from page to page. To begin, I researched different types of navigation systems for html webpages on Google. I found a few different templates online but ended up using a table to make my menu, the tag for table is &lt;table&gt;. I first coded the row and amount of columns. I had seven different pages to link and navigate to. I typed the name of each webpage in the columns. I then made them links using, &lt;a href=&gt;. After I did it once I copy and pasted the code for the navigation system into the code of each webpage. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I learned a lot about coding webpages. I learned how to better use HTML and gained more skill and experience in using it. Some things I struggled with was deciding what kind of navigation system I wanted to create and then coding it and implementing it into every single page. 
Also, matching the final product of my webpage to my design.<p>
