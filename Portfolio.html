My name is Dylan Almeida. I was born 9 December 2002. That makes me 15 years old.
<img src="headshot.jpg" alt="Headshot of Me!" align="left" width="300" height="400">
I live in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts and I go to Greater New Bedford Regional Vocational Technical High School.
I am in the Computer Information Technology shop. I live with my mom and have a younger brother. 
My brother is in 2nd grade at James M. Quinn Elementary School. My favorite sports are baseball and soccer. 
I speak 2 languages, Portuguese and English. Eu nao gosto falar portugues. I also believe that I can flyâ€¦ on a plane. 
At the age of 3, I was in a pretty bad accident with a lawn mower. 
My foot was run over and I was in the hospital for months having surgery after surgery to repair my foot. 
I only have nine and a half toes because of this accident.
